While the use of normal state space models is widespread and well understood, the use of non linear methods requires further work. We presented the theory behind generalized state space models and we reviewed some of the main applications for binomial and count data. The main approach to these methods relies on Monte Carlo methods and it's therefore highly dependent on the computational power offered to approach the problem. The increase in computational power and estimation techniques suggest a strong case for the employment of such models when the data is non normal.
